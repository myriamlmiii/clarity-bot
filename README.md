# ClarityBot 🤖 – Simplify Dense Text with AI

Have you ever read something so complicated you wondered if it was written by a time-traveling alien physicist?  
That’s why I built **ClarityBot** — a tool that simplifies dense, technical text into clearer language without dumbing it down.

## ✨ Features
- Paste any confusing text  
- Select clarity level (e.g., “keep technical” → “beginner friendly”)  
- Get a clear, accurate explanation in seconds  
- Built with **UX-first design** to minimize noise and friction  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TailwindCSS)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + API routes  
- **AI / NLP:** Transformers, HuggingFace models, OpenRouter LLMs  
- **Other:** Vercel (deployment), REST APIs  

---

## 📊 Why It Matters
- 60% of internet users struggle with complex content (Pew Research)  
- Professionals lose **3+ hours/week** decoding jargon  
- No tool today bridges **clarity + precision** — until now

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- ⚠️ Mistral’s API burns tokens like a rocket engine  
- ⚠️ Every “Simplify” button hides 47 edge cases  
- ✅ UX is **removing 90% of the clutter**, not adding features
